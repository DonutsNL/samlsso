# samlSSO
This plugin is a full rewrite by Chris Gralike of Derrick Smith's initial PHPSAML plugin for GLPI. This plugin has evolved quit a bit sinds then and is fully redesigned and rewritten to be compatible with GLPI11. It now support multiple saml idp's, it implement's user right rules and more. The plugin is fully configurable from the GLPI UI and doesnt require any coding skills. It uses GLPI core components where possible for maximum compatibility and maintainability. It implements composer for quick 3rd party library updates if security issue's requires it. It follows the PSR best-practices where possible. And most importantly it is written with a security-by-design-by-default approach in mind to help you visually identify security issues where possible.

## Building some awareness about the OSS funding gap.
- 4000+ downloads and counting.
- Hours spent maintaining and supporting glpisaml/samlsso for the past 3 years,  +1000h and counting, coffees received ytd: 29, hourly compensation for efforts: €0,145. 
- Im not in the begging for money business, but I do want to build some awareness about the OSS funding gab problem. Be honost about the benefits and consider to support the OSS projects you are using and making money off like GLPI. Building quality software is time consuming and expensive!
